  Primary Base Enrichment Additive 3 Initial Start 1A: !!com.romraider.definition.table.Table2DDef

    description: This is the initial afterstart enrichment offset for group 3. This value decays to zero based on the "decay step" value. Group 3 is one of three factors which determines the primary fuel afterstart enrichment. The primary fuel enrichment is a multiplier (determined primarily by the open loop fuel maps) applied to the base injector duration to determine the level of primary enrichment. The enrichment offsets determined by tables 2 and 3 are averaged and added along with table 1 to primary enrichment to determine the final primary enrichment. To determine an approximate AFR for a particular condition, first determine the primary enrichment as determined by the open loop fuel maps (and after other compensations/limits are applied) and calculate the base fueling multiplier as 14.7/x. Then add the additional afterstart enrichment as determined from group 1, and 2/3 (see individual help text) and the approximate AFR will be 14.7/x.

    description: When transitioning between closed loop and open loop fueling, these maximum steps, along with the 'Min Primary Fueling CL to OL Intermediate Enrich' value, determine the number of steps and the intermediate enrichment at each step before the normal primary enrichment is used. When the transition from CL to OL occurs, a counter, starting at zero, is incremented each execution. At zero (if maximum step value is also not zero), the intermediate enrichment value is used. When the counter reaches the maximum value, the primary enrichment is used and the intermediate sequence ends. If the counter is greater than zero and less than the maximum step value, the counter and the maximum value are used to determine the ratio of intermediate to primary enrichment. For example, if the counter is 1 and the maximum value is 2, then the additional enrichment on top of the intermediate enrichment will be one-half of the difference between the primary enrichment and the intermediate value. If the counter is 2 and the maximum value is 3, then the ratio would be two-thirds. To disable the intermediate enrichment behavior, set the maximum steps to zero.

      duration multiplier based on the last calculated injector pulse width and engine

      determines the correction applied to achieve a desired level of enrichment (or
      enleanment). No enrichment or enleanment would result in a base injector duration
      multiplier of 1.0. The offset from this table is added to other factors (such
      as primary open loop enrichment) and then added to this base injector duration
      multiplier to achieve the desired level of enrichment or enleanment. To estimate
      the effect of this compensation, first estimate the desired AFR that the compensation
      would be applied to (ex. 12:1 AFR). Convert this to the base injector duration
      multiplier (ex. 14.7/x = 14.7/12 = 1.225). Add the per injector compensation
      to this multiplier (ex. 1.225 + 0.05 = 1.275). Then convert the multiplier back

      duration multiplier based on the last calculated injector pulse width and engine

      stoich fueling at the current engine load. The base injector duration multiplier
      determines the correction applied to achieve a desired level of enrichment (or
      enleanment). No enrichment or enleanment would result in a base injector duration
      multiplier of 1.0. The offset from this table is added to other factors (such
      as primary open loop enrichment) and then added to this base injector duration
      multiplier to achieve the desired level of enrichment or enleanment. To estimate
      the effect of this compensation, first estimate the desired AFR that the compensation
      would be applied to (ex. 12:1 AFR). Convert this to the base injector duration
      multiplier (ex. 14.7/x = 14.7/12 = 1.225). Add the per injector compensation

Because there is no feedback in open loop, the actual AFR may differ from the values presented in this table. In addition, the ECU applies a long-term correction (A/F Learning) to open loop fueling from patterns it recognizes in closed loop fueling. Other compensations and minimum enrichment factors exist as well. Because the underlying values of this table are enrichment offsets relative to stoichiometric, AFRs leaner than 14.7, as presented, are not valid.

    description: This is the period over which the 'CL to OL with Delay' throttle or base pulse width thresholds must be continuously exceeded before the closed loop to open loop fueling transition can take place. Only one of the four delay groups will be accessed at any given time depending on transmission type and other factors than can vary by ROM. And only one of the four values from each group determines the delay which depends on the time since the last engine start (first value in each grouping is the earliest range). If the current delay is non-zero, the 'CL to OL Transition with Delay (Throttle)' or 'CL to OL Transition with Delay (Base Pulse Width)' tables will be used to determine the transition from closed loop to open loop if either threshold is continuously exceeded over the current delay period. If the delay is zero, then these tables will not be used and the closed loop to open loop transition will be decided by the current enrichment as determined by the 'Primary Open Loop Fueling' and 'Minimum Active Primary Open Loop Enrichment' tables.

The primary fuel enrichment is a multiplier (determined primarily by the open loop fuel maps) applied to the base injector duration to determine the level of primary enrichment. The minimum enrichment offsets determined by tables 1, 2, and 3 are added together to determine the final primary minimum enrichment. That is, regardless of the primary open loop fuel map value, enrichment will not be less than the final primary minimum enrichment. To determine an approximate minimum AFR for a particular condition, determine the final primary minimum enrichment from tables 1, 2, and 3 (adding together all three offsets) and calculate the estimated minimum AFR as 14.7/(1+x).
