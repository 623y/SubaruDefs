      Cruise and non-cruise conditions are determined by a number of factors including

      SI-Drive mode (if applicable). The ECU will ramp between the cruise and non-cruise
      map values when conditions dictate the switch. The actual base timing is determined
      as follows: during a period after initial start (related to AVCS warm-up and
      other factors), the ECU will calculate Base Timing as primary - min0(primary
      - reference), with min0 being a function limiting the (primary - reference)
      result to zero. If you do not want the base timing to follow this behavior,
      set the primary and reference maps to the same values (separated by cruise/non-cruise).
      Total timing = base timing + knock correction advance + other timing compensations.

      as follows: during a period after initial start (related to AVCS warm-up and

      - reference), with min0 being a function limiting the (primary - reference)
      result to zero. If you do not want the base timing to follow this behavior,
      set the primary and reference maps to the same values (separated by cruise/non-cruise).

      Compensation (IAT)'' tables. The compensation is a raw enrichment offset value
      which is added to the raw enrichment offset determined by the ''Primary Open
      Loop Fueling'' table. To determine the estimated change in the effective AFR,
      first convert the primary open loop AFR (x) in question to its raw enrichment
      value: ((14.7/x)-1). Then add the compensation offset from this table to the
      result. Finally, convert this total enrichment (x) to the effective AFR: (14.7/x).
      For example, if the primary open loop fueling map calls for an effective AFR
      of 10.5:1, this would be an enrichment offset of 0.40. If the compensation value
      was 0.10, the total raw enrichment offset would be 0.50. Converting this to

  Base Timing Primary Non-Cruise: !!com.romraider.definition.table.Table3DDef
    category: Ignition Timing - Advance
    description: This is the base level of timing during non-cruise conditions. Cruise and non-cruise conditions are determined by a number of factors including engine speed, requested torque, MAF, vehicle speed, IAT, idle mode, ECT, and SI-Drive mode (if applicable). The ECU will ramp between the cruise and non-cruise map values when conditions dictate the switch. The actual base timing is also determined by the 'Base Timing Reference Non-Cruise (AVCS related)' table. During a period after initial start (related to AVCS warm-up and other factors), the ECU will calculate Base Timing as primary - min0(primary - reference), with min0 being a function limiting the (primary - reference) result to zero. If you do not want the base timing to follow this behavior, set the primary and reference maps to the same values (separated by cruise/non-cruise).Total timing = base timing + knock correction advance + other timing compensations. Knock correction advance = (knock correction advance max map value * current advance multiplier) + feedback knock correction + fine knock correction.

      Switch (IAM)'' table. Because there is no feedback in open loop, the actual
      AFR may differ from the values presented in this table. In addition, the ECU
      applies a long-term correction (A/F Learning) to open loop fueling from patterns
      it recognizes in closed loop fueling. Other compensations and minimum enrichment
      factors exist as well. Because the underlying values of this table are enrichment
      offsets relative to stoichiometric, AFRs leaner than 14.7, as presented, are
      not valid. The switching between the high and low tables occurs based on the
      current portion of ''Knock Correction Advance Additive Max'' that is being applied.
      This is determined by many factors, including knock, knock history and conditions
      that may support knock. The result is a KCA additive multiplier. This multiplier
      ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being high knock and/or conditions and 1 being low
      knock and/or conditions. The final table result will be calculated as follows:
      (high table * multiplier) + (low table * (1.0 - multiplier)).'

      The primary fuel enrichment is a multiplier (determined primarily by the open

      of primary enrichment. The minimum enrichment offsets determined by tables 1,
      2, and 3 are added together to determine the final primary minimum enrichment.
      That is, regardless of the primary open loop fuel map value, enrichment will
      not be less than the final primary minimum enrichment. To determine an approximate
      minimum AFR for a particular condition, determine the final primary minimum
      enrichment offset from tables 1, 2, and 3 (adding together all three offsets)

      the actual AFR may differ from the values presented in this table. In addition,
      the ECU applies a long-term correction (A/F Learning) to open loop fueling from
      patterns it recognizes in closed loop fueling. Other compensations and minimum
      enrichment factors exist as well. Because the underlying values of this table
      are enrichment offsets relative to stoichiometric, AFRs leaner than 14.7, as
      presented, are not valid. The switching between the high and low tables occurs
      based on the current portion of ''Knock Correction Advance Additive Max'' that
      is being applied. This is determined by many factors, including knock, knock
      history and conditions that may support knock. The result is a KCA additive
      multiplier. This multiplier ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being high knock and/or
      conditions and 1 being low knock and/or conditions. The final table result will

    description: This is one of three factors which determines the minimum primary afterstart fuel enrichment. The primary fuel enrichment is a multiplier (determined primarily by the open loop fuel maps) applied to the base injector duration to determine the level of primary enrichment. The minimum enrichment offsets determined by tables 1, 2, and 3 are added together to determine the final primary minimum enrichment. That is, regardless of the primary open loop fuel map value, enrichment will not be less than the final primary minimum enrichment. To determine an approximate minimum AFR for a particular condition, determine the final primary minimum enrichment from tables 1, 2, and 3 (adding together all three offsets) and calculate the estimated minimum AFR as 14.7/(1+x).
