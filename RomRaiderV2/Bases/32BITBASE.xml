WARNING: These definition files are created as the result of the extremely complex and time consuming process of reverse-engineering the factory ECU. Because of this complexity, it is necessary 
to make certain assumptions and, therefore, it is impossible to always deal in absolutes in regards to representations made by these definitions. In addition, due to this complexity and the numerous 
variations among different ECUs, it is also impossible to guarantee that the definitions will not contain errors or other bugs. What this all means is that there is the potential for bugs, errors and 
misrepresentations which can result in damage to your motor, your ECU as well the possibility of causing your vehicle to behave unexpectedly on the road, increasing the risk of death or injury. 
Modifications to your vehicle's ECU may also be in violation of local, state and federal laws. By using these definition files, either directly or indirectly, you agree to assume 100% of all risk and

        <description>This map contains the desired boost targets. Boost compensation tables can impact the final boost target. The switching between the high and low tables occurs based on the current portion of 'Knock Correction Advance Additive B Max' that is being applied. This is determined by many factors, including knock, knock history and conditions that may support knock. The result is a KCA additive B multiplier. This multiplier ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being high knock and/or conditions and 1 being low knock and/or conditions. The final table result will be calculated as follows: (high table * multiplier) + (low table * (1.0 - multiplier)).</description>

Because there is no feedback in open loop, the actual AFR may differ from the values presented in this table. In addition, the ECU applies a long-term correction (A/F Learning) to open loop fueling from patterns it recognizes in closed loop fueling.

When the IAM is less than 1.0, this fuel map is used as a base and the 'Primary Open Loop Fueling Additive' enrichment map is added to determine the final primary open loop fueling. An estimated AFR for this final fueling can be calculated as follows: 14.7/(((14.7/(Base AFR map value)) + (Additive map value * (1.0 - current IAM))). For example, if the 'Primary Open Loop Fueling Base' calls for an effective AFR of 10.5:1 and the 'Primary Open Loop Fueling Additive' map calls for 0.10 enrichment offset compensation and the current IAM is 0.75, then the final primary ol fueling would have an estimated AFR of 10.3:1.</description>

        <description>This fuel map is used in open loop when the ignition advance multiplier (IAM) is greater than or equal to the threshold specified by the 'Primary Open Loop Fuel Map Switch (IAM)' table. Because there is no feedback in open loop, the actual AFR may differ from the values presented in this table. In addition, the ECU applies a long-term correction (A/F Learning) to open loop fueling from patterns it recognizes in closed loop fueling. Other compensations and minimum enrichment factors exist as well. Because the underlying values of this table are enrichment offsets relative to stoichiometric, AFRs leaner than 14.7, as presented, are not valid. The switching between the high and low tables occurs based on the current portion of 'Knock Correction Advance Additive B Max' that is being applied. This is determined by many factors, including knock, knock history and conditions that may support knock. The result is a KCA additive B multiplier. This multiplier ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being high knock and/or conditions and 1 being low knock and/or conditions. The final table result will be calculated as follows: (high table * multiplier) + (low table * (1.0 - multiplier)).</description>

        <description>This is the compensation of the primary open loop fueling based on the combined correction of the 'Timing Compensation (MRP)' and 'Timing Compensation (IAT)' tables. The compensation is a raw enrichment offset value which is added to the raw enrichment offset determined by the 'Primary Open Loop Fueling' table. To determine the estimated change in the effective AFR, first convert the primary open loop AFR (x) in question to its raw enrichment value: ((14.7/x)-1). Then add the compensation offset from this table to the result. Finally, convert this total enrichment (x) to the effective AFR: (14.7/x). For example, if the primary open loop fueling map calls for an effective AFR of 10.5:1, this would be an enrichment offset of 0.40. If the compensation value was 0.10, the total raw enrichment offset would be 0.50. Converting this to an effective AFR would result in a value of 9.8:1.</description>

        <description>This is the base level of timing. Total timing = base timing + knock correction advance + other timing compensations. Knock correction advance = (knock correction advance max map value * current advance multiplier) + feedback knock correction + fine knock correction. The ECU ramps between the Cruise and Non-Cruise table results according to the Map Ratio Primary extended parameter where 0 = Cruise and 1 = Non-Cruise results. In addition Map Ratio Primary 1 and 2 are used to ramp between tables D, E or A, B and F or C respectively. If Map Ratio Primary = 0 only C is used.</description>

        <description>This is the base level of timing during non-cruise conditions. Cruise and non-cruise conditions are determined by a number of factors including engine speed, requested torque, MAF, vehicle speed, IAT, idle mode, ECT, and SI-Drive mode (if applicable). The ECU will ramp between the cruise and non-cruise map values when conditions dictate the switch. The actual base timing is also determined by the 'Base Timing Reference Cruise (AVCS related)' table. During a period after initial start (related to AVCS warm-up and other factors), the ECU will calculate Base Timing as primary - min0(primary - reference), with min0 being a function limiting the (primary - reference) result to zero. If you do not want the base timing to follow this behavior, set the primary and reference maps to the same values (separated by cruise/non-cruise). Total timing = base timing + knock correction advance + other timing compensations. Knock correction advance = (knock correction advance max map value * current advance multiplier) + feedback knock correction + fine knock correction.</description>

        <description>This is the maximum amount of knock-based timing advance (knock correction advance) that can be added to base timing when knock conditions are high. Knock conditions are determined based on a number of factors, including knock, knock history and conditions that may support knock (note: this is not the same as IAM/FLKC/FBKC logic). This primary advance multiplier, which ranges from 0 to 1, determines whether the low or high map is used (or a portion of each). Total timing = base timing + knock correction advance + other timing compensations. Knock correction advance = (((KCA max primary low * primary advance multiplier) + (KCA max primary high * (1.0 - primary advance multiplier))) * IAM) + KCA max additive.</description>

        <description>This is the initial change in the ignition advance multiplier (IAM) when re-evaluation of the IAM begins during a rough correction learning session. When this starts, the IAM is reset to the 'Advance Multiplier (Initial)' value and the step value is added to or subtracted from this value depending on knock. The step value is reduced by half when, during this session, the IAM changes from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa. When the step value is 0, or the IAM hits 0 or 1.0 for a period of time, the IAM re-evaluation ends. This how the ECU determines that the IAM has settled on the appropriate value.</description>

        <description>This is the target throttle plate position during non-cruise conditions. Cruise and non-cruise conditions are determined by a number of factors including engine speed, requested torque, MAF, vehicle speed, IAT, idle mode, ECT, and SI-Drive mode (if applicable). The ECU will ramp between the cruise and non-cruise map values when conditions dictate the switch. The 'Requested Torque Accelerator Pedal to Requested Torque Base RPM (ratio)', which makes up the x-axis of this table, is the ratio of requested torque determined by the 'Requested Torque (Accelerator Pedal)' to the requested torque determined by the 'Requested Torque Base (RPM)' table. This ratio and engine speed are used to determine the target throttle plate opening.</description>
